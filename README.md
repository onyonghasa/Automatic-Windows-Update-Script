# 🪟 Automatic Windows Update Script  
### `UpdateWindowsAuto.ps1`

A simple PowerShell script that automatically checks for, downloads, and installs all available Windows Updates on **Windows 10 / 11**.  
The script ensures that the required PowerShell repository and module (`PSWindowsUpdate`) are properly configured before running updates.  
This version will **ask the user before restarting the system** after installing updates.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Checks for **Administrator privileges**
- Verifies that **PowerShell Gallery (PSGallery)** is trusted
- Installs **PSWindowsUpdate** module if missing
- Scans for available Windows updates
- Installs all updates automatically (`-AcceptAll`) but **does not auto-reboot**
- Prompts the user to restart the system if required
- Saves a **log file** of update history to `C:\WindowsUpdate_Log.txt`
- Displays all progress directly in the PowerShell console

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Windows 10 / 11**
- **PowerShell 5.1+** or **PowerShell 7+**
- Internet connection
- Must be run as **Administrator**

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. **Download or copy** the script:  
   `UpdateWindowsAuto.ps1`

2. **Save it** anywhere (for example: `Desktop`, `C:\Scripts`, etc.)

3. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**

4. **Allow script execution for this session only (recommended)**:

```powershell
set-executionpolicy -scope process -executionpolicy bypass
```

> 💡 On Windows 10, PowerShell will display the "Execution Policy Change" prompt:
>
> ```
> Execution Policy Change
> [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
> ```
>
> Type `Y` and press **Enter**.  
> This change is temporary and only applies to the current PowerShell session. Once PowerShell is closed, the execution policy returns to the default system setting.

5. (Optional) If the script was downloaded from the internet, unblock it first:

```powershell
Unblock-File -Path "C:\Path\To\UpdateWindowsAuto.ps1"
```

6. **Run the script**:

```powershell
.\UpdateWindowsAuto.ps1
```

7. **The script will**:

- Check if **PSWindowsUpdate** is installed  
- Prompt to install it if missing  
- Scan, download, and install all updates  
- If a restart is required, **ask the user** before rebooting
